### Target Audience

### Tech Stack
For this application we will be using:

* Front-end:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React. React will be used to render the content of the application and create a responsive and interactive front-end.

* Back-end:
Node.js, Express.js. Both of these will work in tandem. Node will allow the app to utilise JavaScript on the server-side and express will be used to create the API.

* Database: Mongo DB. Mongo will be the database which stores all of the information on our app. Including jobs, employees etc.

* Authentication: JWT is a common authentication mechanism which we will be utilizing to authenticate users.

* Encryption: Bcrypt. Bcrypt is used to hash passwords and encrypt data for privacy.

* Testing: Vite, Jest. We will be implementing both testing frameworks for the application. This will be useful to cover all bases around testing.

* Others: Discord, Figma, Trello. Discord is used for communication in the team. Figma is used for wiremapping and planning. Trello is used as a team board to cover all tasks.
